# Satellite-Imagery-Segmentation-with-U-Net-Deep-learing-model

Satellite Imagery Segmentation on Image with 3 layers RGB using U-Net Deep learing model
This project aims to segment satellite imagery using a U-Net deep learning model. The model is trained on annotated satellite images to identify specific features of interest, 

such as :  
  - Building
  - Land
  - Road
  - Vegetation
  - Water
  - Unlabeled
  
  and to segment them from the rest of the image.

#### To get started with this project,you can  

### Try to run NoteBooks on Colab Directly by run this one:
  - Satellite_Seg_Prediction_GradioUI.ipynb : for Use the trained model and predict rusltes from Code
  - Satellite-Imagery-Segmentation-with-U-Net-Deep-le.ipynb : for trained the Orignal model from scratch
